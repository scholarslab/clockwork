<h3><b> Introduction</b></h3>
  <p>
ClockWork began with a question: How could we think about time in nonlinear, non-timeline-based ways?
  </p>
  <p>
At its core, this is a project is about time: how we understand time, how we value time, and how people experience time differently according to different lived circumstances and different imaginaries of the world.
  </p>
  <p>
More specifically, ClockWork encourages people to grapple with the monetary value of time for people working in different sectors of the U.S. economy and at different income levels. We have attempted to represent income disparity and frustration here through sound; to express an aesthetics of experience somehow.
</p>
<p>
We arrived at the method of sonification after months of provocative theoretical conversations on the broad topic of time, grounded in our diverse disciplinary perspectives. We chose to produce a series of sonifications for our final project for purposes of expediency, and because as a team we remained committed to creating something that might lend itself usefully to social justice-related efforts, in formal educational settings and beyond.
</p>
<p>
The sonifications use higher pitch and louder volume to represent greater effort during a particular space of time, which pulls attention to the ways in which time is experienced and valued differently across income levels. This aesthetic choice points to the idea that even linear time is not linear in the same way for all people. A minute becomes more arduous, or perhaps feels longer, for someone working a minimum wage jobs than for a high wage earner.
</p>
<p>
At first glance, our project is stark in its simplicity. We are working within the time systems that we know and use everyday (e.g. hourly/monthly/yearly). We’re doing linear, but we’re doing linear sort of slant. We offer this as a productive starting point. Our intention is that this project is “good to think”—that we can think about it, and with it, together.
</p>
<p>
In what follows, we’re going to break it down for you: our thinking at various stages, our hesitations and critiques, and some emergent ideas you may want to consider and run with. We’d also like to link you to other cool projects that are working with similar ideas and challenges. We’ve started an annotated bibliography to get you thinking. We’d also like to show you how to do some of this stuff on your own, or to at least get you started off in a helpful direction.
</p>
<p>
This is the food for thought section of ClockWork.

    <h3> Why Time? </h3>
      <div>
      <p>
  We make all kinds of assumptions about what time means, how time is experienced, and how time can or should be represented. Different disciplines offer rich perspectives on what time means and how we might imagine it conceptually. What do we do when universalizing arguments about time become difficult because we realize that people don’t understand or experience time in the same way? How do we avoid imposing dominant conceptualizations of time onto every question? How do we come to recognize our own biases? Time is a fertile subject to interrogate and theorize because there are endless possibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
In the first several weeks of Praxis, everyone brought in a written piece that grappled with time in interesting and challenging ways. Each of the pieces offered a helpful provocation, and insight into what a diversity of disciplinary perspectives could bring to the subject.

  <p>
<b>Ethan</b> encouraged us to engage with Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “deep time,” in which she “propose[s] a more extended duration for American literary studies, planetary in scope,” because “the force of historical depth is such as to suggest a world that predates the adjective American.” Dimock suggests that conceptualizing time in this way would force scholars of American literature to re-periodize the works they study. In so doing, they would re-interpret American texts and linguistics through large-scale analysis that encourages questions such as: “How does a literary text sound when it is read twenty years, two hundred years, or two thousand years after it was written?” What are/what is the significance of “the traveling frequencies of literary texts”? For Ethan, these provided a helpful point of entry into how scholars of American literature have and could conceptualize time in relation to their discipline.
  </p>
  <p>
<b>Gillet</b> wanted to include historical work that questioned the relationship of time to the present and future, and also interrogated Western ideologies of time. In his 1996 chapter, “The past as future: Aborigines, Australia and the (dis)course of history,” Bain Attwood discusses the dangers of Western historical and archaeological epistemologies that posit the past as separate from the present, such that it becomes possible to analyze and learn objective “truths” about the past. Attwood further warns of the potential for certain modes of producing history to function as a colonizing device. He argues that telling only one particular version of history serves in fact to create the past, the present, and the future (see also Chimimanda Ngozi Adichie on “The Danger of a Single Story”). In this sense, practices of history can function as active means of time-making, rather than merely representations and analysis of what has passed.
  </p>
  <p>
<b>Lydia</b> brought Charles Keil’s 1987 essay, “Participatory Discrepancies and the Power of Music,” to our conversation. According to Keil, musics that are supposedly ‘out of time’ display evidence of humanity, and therefore, become relatable and meaningful in human ways. His notion of participatory discrepancy refers to subtleties that are often too small to notate by conventional means.
  </p>
  <p>
<b>Rachel</b> brought us a canonical article by Karl Stockhausen called “How Time Passes.” In the article, Stockhausen argues that “music is a series of events in time.” Duration and pitch occur in “different areas in one time scale.”
  </p>
  <p>
<b>James</b> introduced us to Kari Kraus, who looks in this article at the long history of the study of textual transmission and places speculative computer-based reconstruction of texts into historical relationship to other forms of speculating on the text, specifically recension editing, divination, and Biblical hermeneutics. In particular, Kraus is interested in “the role of conjecture in textual scholarship,” which she argues “is thus concerned with issues of transmission, transformation, and prediction.”
  </p>
  <p>
<b>Bremen</b> brought in anthropologist Henrick Vigh’s 2008 essay, "Crisis and chronicity,” part of a special edition of Ethnos focusing on “situations of chronic crisis and uncertainty” (7), in which Vigh offers the concept of ‘chronicity’ as a means of grappling with human experience in places where crisis is endemic: less like an event (something that happens), and more like a condition (the way things are). Vigh argues that in places where enduring conditions of crisis characterize everyday lived experience, ethnographers might conceptualize crisis itself as “a terrain of action and meaning,” rather than as background context. Chronic conflict is a space of excess, he argues; a space characterized by excessive violence, yes, but also by heightened awareness of surroundings, and radical possibilities for provisional imagining. When crisis is “endemic rather than episodic” (5), Vigh argues, people tend to live with “increased social reflexivity,” a raised consciousness of “our modes of constructing meaning,” including “the way we interpret the social environment, our perspectives and our horizons” (19). As ethnographers, attenuating our work to such environments means focusing on “how agents act in crisis, instead of through it” (17), he suggests. This may enable us to begin re-examining theoretical categories of ‘praxis’, ‘routinisation’ and ‘narrative’ in terms of ‘navigation’, the ‘provisional’ and “multiple possible terrains.” After all, Vigh argues, “it is through the social imaginary that we locate ourselves in the world, position ourselves in relation to others and seek to grasp that sphere of our existence which we have not yet experienced but which we nonetheless act towards in anticipation” (20). Thinking about time in relation to lived experience thus leads us to focus on the future as a site of ethnographic inquiry.

  <h3> Our Ethos </h3>
      <div>
      <p>
    What are the ethical considerations that underpinned our thinking and working processes throughout the year? What does ethics have to do with the digital humanities?
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Social Justice.</b> Several of us joined the Praxis team with a desire to engage digital humanities tools as a means of furthering social justice-related goals, or at least exploring the potential of DH for engaged projects in the future. This commitment informed our time and temporality-related conversations before we began to conceptualize a finite project (note: the ethical implications of time emerge in case studies and enumerated themes above). When the moment arrived to hunker down and scope a final project, this commitment remained in the background of all of our questions and pitches.
    </p>
    <p>
    We thought in terms of concrete subject areas, such as: <br>
    •	Labor that doesn’t get counted, such as domestic and gendered labor, or prison labor; <br>
    •	Categories of analysis used in polling; <br>
    •	Data that might relate meaningfully to affective experience, such as, what is it like to be a worker in this place in this body.
    </p>
    <p>
    We ended up with lots of ideas for which no adequate data was available, for various reasons:<br>
    •	Areas of non-quantifiable meaning or value (e.g. stuff that cannot be numerically expressed);<br>
    •	Specific, clean, consistent data about prison labor (though some stats exist, we couldn’t find figures that were both trustworthy and representative of the kinds of questions we wanted to ask; in order to work with this kind of data, we would have to launch an intensive research effort, to gather the data ourselves); <br>
    •	Formerly incarcerated people with full voting rights restored (same problem as above).<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Emerging approaches, like <a href="https://jwernimont.wordpress.com/current-courses/feminist-digital-humanities-dhsi/"> Feminist DH</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KzQZ5rV3hkPoiX2ZBMi-s2sfW8KuZKU0iRXGjiaTQV8/edit

    <h3> Why Sonifications? </h3>
      <div>
      <p>
    <b>Rationale</b><br>
    We chose sonification because: We wanted to work with a mode of representation that was different from the visual modes that dominate the digital/internet sphere (e.g. boom in “data visualization” over the past five years). It’s not just the medium being different that makes the experience of time different, or somehow more true. What was key to us is that sonification does some of the same work that a regular visualization would do, but it also does more than that. We want this project to engage with both questions (loosely): 1) How does sonification do what visualization does? And 2) How does sonification do more (or do differently) than visualization? And how? E.g. What are the affordances of sonification? As opposed to visual representations of data? Or a written paper?
    </p>
    <div class="marginalia">
    Interested in making your own sonification? Check out our tutorial [link here]!
    </div>
    <p>
    <b>Possible critiques</b> <br>
    Would it be fair to suggest that sonifications are mostly quite linear, and in effect reproduce the same structures of understanding that are embedded in standard visual representations like graphs, charts. [i.e. the relationships you are representing are the same, the data source is the same, you may have more latitude in terms of pitch, sound quality, and so forth, but effectively, the decision-making process--about ratios/scaling and such--are the same as they would be with a graph]. By this logic, sonifications are, in a Foucauldian sense, simply a different technology for enforcing the same interpretive frames we take for granted. Sonifications are serving the same ends by sexier (or indeed, more sophisticated) means.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>Questions of Representation</b> <br>
    Rendering data aurally may seem to offer a more true experience with the data--true if we are seeking engagement beyond the visual, true if we are captured by sound more than by looking. Sound offers a different affective experience. But both renderings shepard us to the same logical conclusion (people who earn less need to work more in order to afford basic commodities--this is a simple argument, yes; we chose a simple data set with a simple argument on purpose as a starting point for engaging bigger questions).
    </p>
    <p>
    Our logic in choosing sonification is case in point: it had partly to do with wanting visitors to the wormhole to feel the pressure of struggling to pay for basic commodities like milk. We didn’t just want them to see that anesthesiologists make more than minimum wage workers and therefore spend less of a percentage of their salary on basic food; we wanted them to feel that pressure. In other words, we wanted them to experience somehow the qualitative aspects of not earning enough--the stress of it, the urgency of it. Of course, this is impossible. A representation cannot recreate the experience it is representing. It can perhaps imitate. But a secondary affective experience (like data rendered in sound) simply cannot be a direct translation of one person’s qualitative experience to another person (need to explain what this means)[b. VAR piece on Leviathan].
    </p>
    <p>
    Sonification is a political argument like any other form of representation. Moreover, our ability to be affected by sonification relies on particular trainings (eg how we appreciate music, certain kinds of sound. For example, some people were disturbed by first version, they experienced the sounds as harsh. Rachel said that’s normal in academic sound studies communities). We cannot assume that sound (or other senses) are somehow universal. We are all American PhD students who share certain aesthetic and ontological premises (for example, about the ways pressure is represented, about what is too loud, about what constitutes a representation of the data at hand).
    </p>
    <p>
    Of course, the other obvious problem here is that we are working with generalized governmental data: people’s experiences rendered in numbers according to a hyper-specific focus: how much they earn per hour. We have no idea what else is going on in these people’s lives, who they are, where (specifically) they live, what other resources they may or may not have that are not legible according to quantitative methods [Note: This is the critique of sociological methods: see recent This American Life called “For Your Reconsideration”]. This is a key point: our decision to do sonifications meant that we could only use a very specific kind of data (see below, “Sonifications” section). So what the implications of that choice?
    </p>
    <p>
    This raises a variety of questions, some of them ethical. What does it mean to induce an affective experience in someone (assuming this is possible)? Other questions?

    </div>

    <h3>How Did We Select Our Data?</h3>
      <div>
      <p>
    We made a collective decision to represent time through sonifications before we selected a data set. Choosing to do sonifications meant that we could only work with a particular type of information, or data. As  <a href="http://earthzine.org/2013/07/23/sonification-data-like-youve-never-heard-before/" target="_blank"> this website</a>  writes, “sonification… [is] the process of turning scientific data into sound, including music.” Choosing sonification as an approach meant we had to choose clean, numerical data, and we had to be sure that the data was sourced consistently. In other words, we wanted to make sure that we were working with apples and apples, not apples and oranges. So, for example, although we found compelling data about prison labor embedded in narrative pieces (journalism, annual reports), we could not use it to do sonifications because data from the same source including our three categorical parameters--measurable time, earned wages, and commodity cost--were not available. We found one source that offered average prisoner earnings in a particular place. We found another source that investigated the kinds of commodities that have been produced by prisoner labor over the past decade (check it out: you may not know your underpants were the product of slave labor in the U.S. [link]). But we had no way of correlating this data according to the parameters (working time-rate of pay-commodity cost) that we needed to make the sonifications work.
      </p>
      <p>
    We ended up selected data exclusively from government sources: the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the X, Y. In the process of selecting our data, we thought to ourselves, hey, actually this process might be useful to other people. Why don’t we pick something super simple so we can explore all the considerations involved even in the simplest data representation. That’s what this website[curriculum] is about!
      </p>
      <p>
    To recap: our choice to build a series of sonifications means that there still many exciting discussions to be had about how to integrate humanities ideas into digital praxis. Many (most) of the ideas we brainstormed during the first several months of the fellowship cannot be neatly represented through a sonification, since sonifications (as defined above) cannot, by definition, emerge from qualitative research.
      </p>
      <p>
    With these constraints in mind, we revisited our earlier interests in relation to time to see how we could select a data set that both resonated with our guiding ethos and stimulated an intellectually engaging conversation about time. With our selection of data and use of sonification, we aimed to have you, the visitors to our site/portal/wormhole (aka ClockWork), use our method and inquiry as a springboard to further explore time theories, develop technical skills, and perhaps make your own sonifications, time-related or not, about data that’s interesting to you.
      </p>
      <p>
    With all this in mind, we cycled back to earlier conversations about time in order to see what discussions could possibly correspond to clean, numerical data that would help us to make a sonification. We landed on our conversations regarding the connections between labor, consumption, and time. During these conversations, we had discussed such questions as: How is time embodied in a physical item available for purchase/consumption? How do our relationships to “things” vary based on the valuations of our time by our employers and/or governmental entities and institutions? How does one’s experience of time working differ when their time is valued differently? How do race, gender, age, sexuality impact the experience of laboring time?
      </p>
      <p>
    Thinking along these lines led us (Ethan, in particular) to find governmental data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on the average price of milk and gasoline during the months of 2014, as well as the BLS average and median incomes for a range of professions in the same year. Once having landed on this dataset, we thought about the problems embedded within the selection of governmental data; e.g., this data doesn’t reflect hidden labor such as prison and domestic labor; nor does it include “black market” labor--both of which include important work that is valued at significantly lower hourly wages than the minimum wage. Yet, we could find no comprehensive information on such labor. Thus, this labor is hidden both in the sense of not being recognized by large swaths of the American public, or not being recognized as labor, but also, and perhaps more insidiously, the labor is “hidden” in the sense that the government does not include it in its data collection, rendering the labor and laborers invisible and/or nonexistent in the eyes of governmental institutions. Without having performed the data collection of hidden labor ourselves, culling together data on largely unrecognized labor from a variety of sources would be problematic because we don’t know exactly what was being measured or counted as labor, how the data was collected, etc. Because sonification requires neat, clean data, we then returned to the BLS statistics with awareness of the shortcomings of the dataset. Given that the BLS offers information on a variety of areas of employment as well as on consumptive activity, we knew that by selecting this data we could be sure we were comparing apples to apples, so to speak.
      </p>

  <h3> What Does the Digital Offer? </h3>
    <div>
      <p>
    What is exciting about digital humanities is the ways in which digital tools can help us to understand things differently, and therefore, to explore new conceptual possibilities and make new arguments.  How can digital tools, then, help us to provoke further contributions to understandings of time?
    </p>

    </div>
      <p>
    This project started theoretically (e.g. through theoretical brainstorming sessions over the course of the Fall 2015 semester) as the digital interpreting the humanities. In practice, the project has become the humanities interpreting the digital. Ultimately, our desire is to work simultaneously--and seamlessly--in both modes).
      </p>
      <p>
    To carry the initial question forward: How can digital tools help us to further interpret theoretical contributions about time?
    </p>
      <p>
    Brainstorm time! Some broad categories/girdles for thinking about/with time/temporality:
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Experience.</b> How do we experience time? How do the ways we conceptualize time in the abstract influence the ways we experience it in real life? What happens when people understand time in different ways?
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Space and Geography</b>(as in human/cultural geography)
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Senses, Sensory, Sensation. hearing, feeling, smelling, seeing, taste (e.g the Western 5) + [...]</b>
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Embodied Time and Affect.</b> rhizomatic, looping (human experience beyond the level of consciousness)
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Race, Gender, Sexuality, Class, Age/Generation</b>
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Politics.</b> Time in terms of the space during/between legislative, Congressional, Senatorial, and Presidential electoral cycles. The time during which a political regime is in place, and how that time is felt by varying political subjects and policymakers. For example, Jim Crow. On a more specific level, the time in which a policy is the law of the land--e.g., the time in which the Voting Rights Act was enacted and implemented, before the Supreme Court of the United States eviscerated meaningful aspects/teeth of the law. The fundraising cycles now mandatory for national political offices, as well as, to a lesser extent, local and statewide elected positions.
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Legal.</b> Related to above, but also, the doctrinal periods of law in relation to: contract; free speech; rights of assembly; vagrancy; voting; citizenship; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Narrative.</b> (Labov)
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Geological.</b>
    Fernand Braudel lays out his philosophy of time, which he posits occurs along three planes, all moving at different speeds and with corresponding differences in the level of impact on people and history. The first (and to Braudel, the most significant) is geographic time--which is cyclical, almost imperceptible, and shapes all events major and minor. This time does not work the same across the globe; in other words, it is a geologic time that varies across regional geographies, such as, in this case, the Mediterranean. The second is political/economic or social time, from which we can learn the history of groups and groupings. And finally there is the time in which individuals’ daily cycles and interpersonal interactions occur. This, for Braudel, is the most superficial level of history, the least impactful, and the fastest passage of time.
      </p>
      <p>
    <b>Cyclical</b> (but that goes across many of these categories)<br>
    <b>Illness (ask Scott--Maybe just incorporate into Experience??)</b>
    </div>


<h3> Critique of Our Own Work </h3>
  <div>
  <p>
What are possible avenues going forward for improving upon this project? How could we make it better? (Who are we asking? What role do we expect these answers to play?) <br>

<b>Attwood, Bain, ed. <i>In the Age of Mabo: History, Aborigines and Australia.</i> St. Leonards, Australia: Allen & Unwin, 1996.</b><br>
In his chapter, “The Past as Future: Aborigines, Australia and the (dis)course of History,” Attwood discusses the dangers of both (Western) historical and archaeological epistemologies which posit that the past is completely separate from the present, and thus able to be analyzed to learn objective “truths” about the past. Attwood further warns of the potential for the act and product of history to function as a colonizing device, in which telling a particular version of history in fact creates a past, a present, and a future. Thus, history can function as a means of time-making rather than or in addition to the representation and analysis of time past. He does many other important and interesting things with this article, but this is what Gillet was drawn to in terms of thinking about the relationship between epistemologies of time and of history.

<b>Auslander, Leora. "Coming Home? Jews in Postwar Paris." <i>Journal of Contemporary History</i> 40, no. 2 (2005): 237-259.</b><br>
Auslander argues that historians should expand their understanding of sources to include material culture. She writes, “Experiences come to be lodged in things; loss of the object-companion of an experience, therefore, threatens the loss of the memory itself.” (239) For Gillet, this article is helpful in furthering our exploration of the connection between time and things. (See Ethan’s blog posts and visualizations for a look at some of these inquiries.) For instance: How can particular times be experienced/reexperienced through physical things and spaces? How do domestic workers’ (both professional and unprofessional) laboring time “animate” the objects with which people interact in their homes? How are temporal experiences written throughout the physical spaces of one’s home, school, workplace, etc?

<b>Braudel, Fernand. <i>The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II</i>, Vol. I. New York: Harper and Row Publishers, 1972.</b><br>
Here, Braudel lays out his philosophy of time, which he posits occur  along three planes, all moving at different speeds and with differing  levels of influence on history/people's lives. The first (and to  Braudel, the most significant) is geographic time--which is cyclical,  almost imperceptible, and shapes all events major and minor. The second  is political/economic or social time, from which we can learn the  history of groups and groupings. And the finally there is the time in  which individuals'  daily cycles and interpersonal interactions occur.  This, for Braudel, is the most superficial sense of history and the  fastest passage of time.

<b>Dimock, Wai Chee. “A Theory of Resonance,” <i>PMLA</i>. October 1997, Vol. 112, No. 5, pp. 1060-1071.</b><br>
Wai Chee Dimock’s concept of “deep time… propose[s] a more extended duration for American literary studies, planetary in scope…. the force of historical depth is such as to suggest a world that predates the adjective American.” Dimock suggests that by doing so, scholars of American literature would have to re-periodize the works they study and re-interpret American texts and linguistics through large-scale analysis that allows us to question: “How does a literary text sound when it is read twenty years, two hundred years, or two thousand years after it was written?” and what are/what is the significance of “the traveling frequencies of literary texts”? Her works go much further than these musings, but for Ethan, these provided a helpful entre into how scholars of American literature have and could conceptualize time in relation to their discipline.

<b>Drucker, Johanna. "Humanities approaches to graphical display." <i>DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly</i> 5, no. 1 (2011): 1-21.</b><br>
This article starts thinking through how humanists can start to use visualization tools in a way that aligns with humanistic methodology (and not just sciences from which it is usually borrows!). Also starts theorizing that all data is really capta when, in her words in the abstract, "rethought through a humanistic lens." This is really cool stuff, and was helpful to us as we were thinking through visualization, sonification, and other possibilities for our Praxis project. Here’s a <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html" target="_blank">link to the digital version</a> of the article.

<b>Frazier, Sarah. “Sonification: Data like you’ve never heard before.” <i>Earthzine</i>. 23 July 2013.</b><br>
Frazier explains sonifications in layman’s terms. She doesn’t get into the nitty gritty of coding, but rather describes general methods of sonifying and provides examples of uses of sonification. The examples she gives demonstrate the use sonifications for making large quantities of scientific data more easily digestible.

<b>Underwood, Ted. "Theorizing research practices we forgot to theorize twenty years ago." <i>Representations</i> 127, no. 1 (2014): 64-72.</b><br>
Underwood writes about how algorithmic mining of big data sets is in many ways blackboxed, but he's critical of people not talking about how their searching, what for, and so on - all the stuff we're trying to make transparent. His words: (65) "The scholarly consequences of search practices are difficult to assess, since scholars tend to suppress descriptions of their own discovery process in published work." All about how, quoting from that main page, "defining a discipline becomes more an exercise of exclusion than inclusion.
