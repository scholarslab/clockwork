**Question 1: What is this?**

Elevator pitch: “Learning, we want you to do it” -Gillet

“Curriculum” refers to the interrelated learning aspects of this project, it does not necessarily mean a concrete *curriculum* as such. In other words, the Curriculum Team is an internal team whose effort have to do with determining what we want people to learn, how we can best help them to learn it. This team is also responsible for coordinating with the other teams to make the wormhole an integrated and holistic learning experience.

1. Technical Skills:
  * How to do sonifications of relatively basic data sets using Super Collider, in order to make arguments by comparison. For the time being, we will show people how to work with CSV files. We will do this ourselves. Starring Rachel and James.
	* Javascript
  *	CSS/HTML
  *	Thinking about data as a skill: as in, working with data is a skill that we’re helping people build. We are introducing a holistic approach to working with data.

2.	Data (finding data and asking productive critical questions about it):
  *	Researching data: finding sources, who is funding the data collection, who is choosing the questions that the data is supposed to answer
  *	Making sense of the data itself, and making sense of the data in broader context (e.g. once we understand what the data means, why do we care about it outside of itself)
  *	Manipulating and presenting data
	* Addressing data shortcomings/limitations and tensions/contradictions that arise; imagining productive possibilities for data use
*	Access to resources like computers and wi-fi, librarians, mentors, learning environments (online, local groups/organizations)

3.	Theoretical Resources and Conversations (aka linky dinks):
	* Annotated bibliographies (thoughts + guiding questions/provocations + other related things to read)
*	Ethics, Time, Digital Humanities, Race, Gender, Class
*	Avoiding reproducing problematic stuff (re: race, gender, class, etc.). For example, see Miriam Posner article/blog post about how we structure building archives or digital humanities projects and how that can structure the inequalities in our daily lives and thoughts. Taking into account, for example, how much minimum wage time goes into looking at a website like the one we are building.

4.	Documentation (treating documentation as a corollary process that is integral to any sort of digital humanities project including hopefully the one you make)
  *	Why documentation is important to the other parts of the project: documentation sets you up for a more meaningful and rigorous project
  *	Formatting—literally, how do you take effective notes during the process of making a project (insights from DH, different disciplines represented by Praxis)
  *	Determining what is important to document
  *	Relating the documentation meaningfully to the final project you present
